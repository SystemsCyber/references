This is a repository for bibtex and MS Word XML files for technical literature related to research of vehicle networks and EDRs. The goal of this repository is to quickly be able to create accurate and consistent bibliographies in either MS Word or Latex using BibTex. JabRef is a program that can export bibtex files to MS Word format. The native source file in this repsitory is the bibtex file. 

The hope is this repository will serve the technical community researching vehicle networking, crash reconstruction and event data recorders.
